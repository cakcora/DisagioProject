# SparkGraphXTutorial
An expanded tutorial of Apache Spark GraphX Library with standalone examples in 13 chapters.


This project hosts the expanded version of the examples given at the official GraphX website at http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html



The tutorial has been divided into 13 scala classes that can be run with instantiated graphs, and outputs have been explained in the code with comments and printlns. Each class takes its title from a subsection in the Apache tutorial.

**_I suggest the reader to start with GraphX9Builders.scala_** and first understand how a graph can be created, Next, work on GraphX10VertexEdgeRDD.scala and then continue to GraphXTutorial1Basic.scala until you reach the end of the classes. GraphX0Builder is a helper class to create graphs used in the project. You may pass over it.

While working on examples, keep http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html and first read the related section in the tutorial.
