# Spark GraphX Tutorial
An expanded tutorial of the Apache Spark GraphX library with standalone examples in 13 chapters.


This project hosts the expanded version of the examples given at the official GraphX website.



The tutorial has been divided into 13 scala classes, and outputs have been explained in the code with comments and printlns. 

**_<a href="https://github.com/cakcora/SparkGraphXTutorial/blob/master/src/main/scala/GraphX9Builders.scala">I suggest the reader to start with GraphX9Builders</a>_** to learn how a graph can be created, Next, work on GraphX10VertexEdgeRDD.scala and then continue to GraphXTutorial1Basic.scala until you reach the end of the classes. GraphX0Builder is a helper class to create graphs used in the project. You may pass over it.

While working on examples, keep http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/graphx-programming-guide.html and first read the related subsection in the tutorial. 

For more information, here is a GraphX book (that has two free chapters): https://www.manning.com/books/spark-graphx-in-action .


Other than GraphX, GraphFrames have also been developed for GraphOps on Spark. You can find a starting point on GraphFrames here: http://graphframes.github.io/
